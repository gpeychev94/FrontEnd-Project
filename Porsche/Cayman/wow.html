The new Cayman GT4 is the long-awaited step beyond the boundary. The step over to the other side of the frontier – onto the racetrack. It’s our tribute to all the motorsport enthusiasts and performance motivators. To all those who really do mean business. To all the victories of tomorrow, to all the personal bests still to be achieved.

For this reason, we’ve given it everything it needs – not just to survive on the racetrack, but to blow it away. More downforce. More traction. More capacity. More thrust. More power. More than any Cayman has ever had before. That’s what makes it the Cayman GT4: the super GT with the distinctive mid-engine layout.

<div class="Article">Here, there are more to things than appearance alone. Here, every form has a function. The result is a crucial plus for performance.

That’s why the front end is not only sharp on the eye, it is primarily designed to carve through the wind. The highly distinctive front spoiler lip stretches across the full width of the front apron. Together with the extra spoiler elements ahead of the wheel arches, it helps to increase aerodynamic downforce at the front axle. Large air intakes provide a generous flow of air to the coolant radiators. The central air intake additionally directs airflow upwards through the outlet to the front of the luggage compartment lid, also reinforcing aerodynamic downforce at the front axle. Titanium-coloured expanded-metal grilles protect the radiators from stone impact.

The muscular wings typical of any Porsche incorporate Bi-Xenon headlights with an internal black theme.

Even the side air intakes behind the doors are a perfect example of performanceoriented design: sideblades embossed with the ‘GT4’ logo help to boost ram pressure. The results are improved air induction and more efficient cooling of the engine.

The new Cayman GT4 gets closer to the tarmac: its body sits 30 mm lower than that of the Cayman. The advantage being a lower centre of gravity for especially sporty handling.</div>
