<div class="Article">Force is defined as mass times acceleration. But it’s much more than that. It means powering on when others would simply pull over. It means giving everything you’ve got to push the limits of feasibility.</div>

<div class="Article">That’s what the Panamera Turbo S manages to do. With 419 kW (570 hp), it achieves 37 kW (50 hp) more than the Panamera Turbo. Thanks to the standard Sport Chrono Package with overboost function, its maximum torque is 800 Nm, whilst it sprints from 0 to 200 km/h in just 12.8 seconds, and from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds, and achieves a top speed of 310 km/h.</div>	   
<div class="Article">Yet this enhanced performance is also accompanied by improved efficiency: despite its increased power output, the Panamera Turbo S achieves the same fuel economy in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) as the Panamera Turbo.</div>
<div class="Article">And it’s not only in terms of engine power that we are reinvigorating the fascination of the sports car. In order to push its driving dynamics, stability and safety to their absolute limits, we have equipped the standard specification of the Panamera Turbo S with everything it needs to live up to the S in its name: active all-wheel drive Porsche Traction Management (PTM), Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) including Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus), air suspension including Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), Power steering Plus, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) and LED main headlights including Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS).</div>
